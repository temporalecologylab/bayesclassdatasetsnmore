# Consider the two datasets (below) and report on the model you recommend fitting. 
# Would you fit a hierarchical model? Yes or no and why?
# If you would fit a hierarchical model, what exact type and why? Give the notation. 
# Once you finish that, fit the model and pull out the most relevant metric for the aim stated.

## Dataset 1
# Data on judges' scores for pairs figure skaters across two programs: short (program) and artistic (performance). 
# Aim: You want to award an Olympic medal in figure skating to the best pair in the short program.
