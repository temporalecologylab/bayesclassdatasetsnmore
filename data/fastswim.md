# Swimming damselfiles

This is a dataset of damselfly swimming performance that is the basis for a few papers from the late 1990's-2005 by Mark McPeek and colleagues. They were looking for species differences. Many of these also scale with "size" (i.e., wet mass here).

### The variables are:

Species - obviously.  You can probably figure out my codes by going to the Odonata Central website and looking at the list of Enallagma. The species code is E + first three letters of the specific epithet (e.g., Easp = Enallagma aspersum).  There's also Ischura verticalis (Iver) and Chromargion conditum (Ccon).

Individ - individual number

Wetmass - wet mass in mgs

Speed - fastest swim of three (this was the response variable - how fast could the individual swim)

Swimbeat - rate at which it wagged its abdomen to generate thrust during fastest swim

Tailamp - maximum amplitude during tail beat

LDH - enzyme kinetic rate of the enzyme Lactate dehydrogenase (searching for biochemical causes of swim speed)

PK - enzyme kinetic rate for pyruvate kinase

AK - enzyme kinetic rate for arginine kinase (this was the keeper for swimming across species)

Area - surface area of abdominal lamellae used to generate thrust during swimming (average of three)

Perim - perimeter of abdominal lamellae

MajAxis - major axis length of abdominal lamellae

Breadth  - longest distance across lamellae perpendicular to major axis. i.e., width.

. and -9999 are missing data
