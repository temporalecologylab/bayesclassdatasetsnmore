## What is this repo?
This is a repo Lizzie started in January 2025 to keep a clean version of the datasets that can be used for homework in Bayesian classes. And (for now) wiki notes and other useful info.

It is *not* where people should post their homework. 
I will make a different (new) repo for each year for that and upload the analyses folder there. 

In 2025, your repo to post your homework is [here.](https://github.com/temporalecologylab/bayes2025homework)
